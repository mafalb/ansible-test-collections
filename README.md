# Ansible Collections for CI

We need small collections to test

1. Our reusable Github workflows
2. Our collection skeleton

The contents in the dev branch is run periodically, but is also triggered by push to the development branch of [ansible_collection_skeleton@dev][ansible_collection_skeleton]
